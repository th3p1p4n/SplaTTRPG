# SplaTTRPG
A tabletop roleplaying game system inspired by Nintendo’s Splatoon series.

Version 1.0.0­­­, May 2023

## Introduction
There exists a distant future -- one of many -- where after the fall of the last remaining human society, the essence of mankind will be infused into the creatures that remain. This is the setup for Nintendo's Splatoon games: a benevolent post-apocalyptic world where, despite the extinction of land-dwelling mammals, twisted remnants of humanity remain.
This game system is a work in progress meant to be geared towards Splatoon fans who are interested in the games’ universe and lore. All sessions follow the same day structure meant to encapsulate sections of time and get people into a routine. It focuses on the mundane, the everyday: the relationships, interactions, and activities that make life special and days unique in the ever-present cycle of work-sleep-play.

## Character Creation

1. Physical Characteristics: determine your character’s species (inkling or octoling), hairstyle, eye color, eye shape, eyebrow shape, or other physical characteristics. These traits have no impact on their in-game skills, but you may choose to relate them to their history.
2. History: determine where your character lives, who they know, their age, where they grew up, etc. If playing with a GM, be sure to talk to them about what may be appropriate for your character.

## Mechanics

### Energy
A character’s energy is represented by energy points split into two pools: Social and Physical. 

Whenever one of these pools reaches zero, a character may use points from the opposite pool to substitute, but they must use twice as many points.

If both pools reach zero, a character is burnt-out and may not participate in the following day’s activities (this includes leveling-up). The day after that, they regain all energy points and can once again participate as normal.

### Day system

Each day is broken into four sections: morning, afternoon, evening, and night. It is recommended that each play session consists of a single day, but a different pacing may be determined by the group.

Each section, a character may choose one of the following things to do:

• Socialize – Hang out in the plaza!
    ◦ Roll 1d6. Subtract that value from your Social energy pool.
    ◦ You may purchase clothes, weapons, and décor.
    ◦ Alternatively, you may attempt to socialize with a NPC, at the GM’s discretion.
        ▪ If you succeed, gain +1 in a Social Skill of your or your GM’s choosing.
• Battle – Duke it out for cash and fame!
    ◦ Roll 1d6. Subtract that value from BOTH energy pools. Choose one of the following:
        ▪ Turf War: roll 1d6.
            • If even: gain 500 Cash.
            • If odd: gain 1500 Cash.
        ▪ Anarchy Battle & Salmon Run: to be added in future versions.
• Adventure – Spend some time exploring!
    ◦ Roll 1d6. Subtract that value from your Physical energy pool.
    ◦ Complete a task or obstacle course determined by the GM or pre-constructed (note: there are no pre-constructed obstacles in this version of the game).
        ▪ If you succeed, gain +1 in a Technical Skill of your choosing.
• Head Home – Take a breather back at your pad! 
    ◦ Refill both energy pools. 
    ◦ If you choose this option twice in a row, gain 2d6 temporary energy points, distributed in whatever fashion you wish.
    ◦ Additionally, you may use this time to equip different items and/or decorate your space.

At the end of a day, each player’s level increases by one.

At each level up, you may increase either pool’s max value by 1.

### Action resolution

Whenever a character attempts to do something that relates to one of their skills, they may perform a skill check by rolling 1d20 and adding their skill modifier. The higher the number, the more successful their attempt is.

## GM Section

This is intended for use in groups of two or more players. 

The Game Master (GM) is responsible for acting as NPCs, managing non-character-specific dice rolls, and keeping a running plot in campaigns spanning more than one session.

It is not necessary to play this game with a GM. Here are a few examples of how a group may choose to forgo the common GM-players setup:

1. Take turns working through scenarios for each player’s action choice at each phase of the day. When one player (or more) is engaged in an activity, the player(s) not engaged in that activity serve as the GM by acting as NPCs and calculating dice rolls.
2. Each player plays in Solo Mode simultaneously. They engage with each other only when their characters’ paths intersect. This can be done either synchronously or asynchronously.
3. A group of players determine that their characters exist in the same world, but they do not focus on interacting with one another. The state of the world is kept in a shared location, and things done by player characters can impact the state of the world. Characters can grow relationships and interact with each other without ever talking out of character.
